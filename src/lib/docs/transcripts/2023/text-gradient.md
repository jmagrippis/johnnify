# Text Gradient with vanilla CSS üç¶, or with Tailwind! ‚õµÔ∏è (for your stylish hero sections)

Hello and welcome, I‚Äôm Johnny and YOU want stylish colourful text for your hero sections!

Gradient text has been trending massively! You can go really subtle, or REALLY loud, so let‚Äôs learn how it works and the world is your oyster!

We‚Äôll first break this down with vanilla CSS, then also show how to do it with Tailwind, and we‚Äôll finish with a couple bonus tips & gotchas.

## with vanilla üç¶ CSS

So, we can start with any HTML element with text inside, like this h1. We know we can change the colour of the text by setting color‚Ä¶ to something like‚Ä¶ papayawhip, one of the extended colour keywords, or to a hex code‚Ä¶ or to Hue Saturation Lightness‚Ä¶

Given how this works, we‚Äôd wish for things to be as simple for our text gradient effect, to be able to specify a gradient right here somehow. Like, I‚Äôd love for linear-gradient(to right, start from plum, end on aquamarine) to work‚Ä¶ But this is CSS and it‚Äôs only 2023, so this doesn‚Äôt work, whatever madness we did here gets ignored.

But I didn‚Äôt completely make this up, this is the way to set a gradient‚Ä¶ for backgrounds, so if‚Ä¶ instead of targeting the text colour, we set the background to a linear gradient, from left to right, from plum to aquamarine, we do get a lovely gradient!

For the background, we can specify all sorts of gradients with all sorts of angles and styles, and we can even use Josh Comeau‚Äôs excellent gradient generator to end up with something even more fun and complicated.

And it turns out, we can use this gradient background to make our text colourful. You see, there is this `background-clip` property we can set to `text`. Listen carefully, this does NOT make our background disappear, this makes our background render behind anywhere there‚Äôs text. Of course, if it‚Äôs behind our text we cannot see it! But we can finish off this style hack by setting our text‚Ä¶ color to transparent and‚Ä¶ BOOM! Text gradient!

So, again, we set a background colour, we specify we only want it rendered behind our text, and then we make our text transparent. Bing, bang, boom. The order we do this does not actually matter, but it is how my mind understands the process. It also works with radial gradients, or even images, but I haven‚Äôt really seen either of those in the wild, while linear gradients seem to be everywhere.

## with ‚õµÔ∏è Tailwind.css

Alright, now we understand the process, let‚Äôs see how we can do the same with my favourite CSS framework, Tailwind.

The idea is the same, we apply a gradient with the class `bg-gradient-to-r`. We can specify the colour we want to start from like `from-purple-400`, and the colour we want to end in, like `to-emerald-400`. In my projects I like configuring my primary and secondary colour palettes, so I can instead do **`from-primary-400 to-secondary-400`**, which makes it easier to copy & paste styling like this across projects with different branding. I don‚Äôt have to remember to change every `purple` to `teal` or whatever, each project‚Äôs tailwind config is the source of truth for what the colours should be.

In any case, we‚Äôve got the gradient, step 2 is making the background clip to the text, which we do with `bg-clip-text`, and, finally we make the text transparent with‚Ä¶ `text-transparent`. Woohoo!

And we can still customise the angle of the gradient‚Ä¶ we can specify multiple colour stops‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs fun, I love that gradients are back in style!

## Animated gradients, other tips + LIKE üíú SUBSCRIBE

Whether it‚Äôs vanilla, or Tailwind, or something else, I do see this trick applied to the parent HTML element too; it‚Äôs not just for headings. For example, we can have a `section` containing multiple other elements, all of which get a piece of that background gradient. But do keep in mind that the effect will change if the container‚Äôs width and height is responsive, and not directly dependent on the text size.

Actually, this may spark some creativity, because we cannot directly animate a gradient with CSS, but we CAN animate the background position.

So if we use `background-size` to double the width of our background‚Ä¶ and then we create an animation which sets the `background-position` from 0 to 100%‚Ä¶ and have that animation play forever in a ping-pong style‚Ä¶ We get‚Ä¶

Wow‚Ä¶ ü§©
